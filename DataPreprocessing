1.> Prepare the data. 
	In every dataset. There is dependent data and independent data. 
	Using a machine learning model we will try to use the independent data to predict the outcome of the dependent data. 
	We will do it for all the machine learning models. 
	Try to make a template so that you can use it to create PreProcess data from all the machine learning models.
