Data Preprocessing ToDos
------------------------

1.> Get the dataset

	- In every dataset. There is dependent data and independent data. 
	- Using a machine learning model we will try to use the independent data to predict the outcome of the dependent data. 
	- We will do it for all the machine learning models. 
	- Try to make a template so that you can use it to create PreProcess data from all the machine learning models. 


2.> Import the libraries


3.> Import the Dataset


4.> Missing Data


5.> Categorical Data


6.> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set


7.> Feature Scaling 


8.> Data Preprocessing Template
